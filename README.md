# Using the NIST cybersecurity framework to respond to a security incident
This repository is an activity in within google cybersecurity course in which as securiy analyst i conduced a security incident using the NIST framework.
The organization recently experienced a DoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved. During the attack, organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. The cybersecurity team investigated the security event and found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a denial of service (DoS) attack.
